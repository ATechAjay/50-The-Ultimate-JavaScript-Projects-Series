💡 Learning from this project? 
 
📌 Remove & add the class at the same event.
📌 Expanding and collapsing logic

📌 Expanding and collapsing logic

→ Just we have to increase the width of the card or box using JavaScript.

→ For example we can increase the width of the box from 100px to 500px using JavaScript.

→ So first of all we have to write our HTML code for the card.

→ There are 7 children in a container with a "card" class names. [pic.twitter.com/TV9FsfFQeK](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1530027250657005568/photo/1)

→ In the CSS code, we have to add a class that is an "active" class.

→ This class is responsible for expanding and collapsing the card.

→ If this class is applied to an element then the element will expand otherwise collapse.

→ This is the design of the cards and the width of the card is 10vh initially.

→ That means when the card is being collapsed the width of the card is 10vh. [pic.twitter.com/92jUVL8FST](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1530027261541634050/photo/1)

→ When the "active" class is applied to an element then the width of the element will be increased to 60vh. [pic.twitter.com/Aq0NvuIBJq](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1530027269816991744/photo/1)

→ So first of all we have to select the HTML card elements using JavaScript.

→ And it returns the list of the NODE similar to an array. [pic.twitter.com/8dYFywryMw](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1530027277849075713/photo/1)

![3_1530021834091294720](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FTu6wG-acAAeq_y.png)

→ So now we have to listen to events on each element that's why we need to loop all elements using for loop.

→ And just we have to add an "active" class to the element. [pic.twitter.com/5XA0kItPrS](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1530027286787129344/photo/1)

![3_1530022368986681344](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FTu7PPnaUAA6PUZ.png)

→ But before adding the "active" class to the element we have to remove the existing "active" class from the element.

→ So we have to create a new function for this requirement. [pic.twitter.com/EHnKvePaZI](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1530027295645499393/photo/1)

![3_1530024285183832064](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FTu8-yAacAAGTXL.png)

→ Finally, we have to call this function before adding the "active" class to the element.

→ In line number 3, I have called that function which is going to remove the "active" class from the element.

→ Then the "active" class is added to an element. [pic.twitter.com/Zgv9xTUMuy](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1530027303581130752/photo/1)
