Yes, there is a significant difference between the two lines you provided:

1. `import { API_KEY } from "./utils";`
2. `import { API_KEY } from "./utils.js";`

In JavaScript, when you use the `import` statement to import a module, you need to specify the file extension unless the file is being imported as a default export from another module. Here's the breakdown:

1. **`import { API_KEY } from "./utils";`**: In this line, you're attempting to import the `API_KEY` from a module located at "./utils". Without specifying the ".js" extension, the browser may not be able to locate the file correctly, leading to errors like the one you encountered.

2. **`import { API_KEY } from "./utils.js";`**: Here, you explicitly specify the ".js" extension, which tells the browser exactly where to find the module. This line is correct and should work as expected, provided that the "utils.js" file exists at the specified location.

In summary, the inclusion of the file extension in the import statement is necessary to accurately specify the location of the module you want to import. Without it, the browser may encounter difficulties locating the file, resulting in errors during the import process.
