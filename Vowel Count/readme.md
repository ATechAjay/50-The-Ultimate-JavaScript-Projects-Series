### 🛠 How to build it? 👇


◈ So first of all, we have to select the HTML elements using JavaScript.

◈ Now we have to listen to a "click" event on the button element and vowelCounter is a function.

😍 Now let's create this function in 3 steps.

1️⃣ Inside this function we have set 0 to the "count" variable initially.

◈ Users can put characters lower and capital letters at the same time that's why we have to change the "case" in one of them.

◈ So I've converted all characters into lowercase using the toLowerCase( ) method.

◈ The toLowerCase( ) method converts a string to lower case letters.

◈ And of course, it doesn't change the original string.

◈ Converted all letters into the small case using this method.

2️⃣ Now we have to iterate all letters using for loop.

◈ Let's create a new variable for individual characters.

◈ And just check a character vowel or not using regular expression.

◈ If the character matches with regular expression then we have to increase the count variable.

◈ And finally, print that "count" value on the screen.

That's all 😍
