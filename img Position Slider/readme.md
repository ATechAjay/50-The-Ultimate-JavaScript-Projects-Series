‚óì Now, this is the CSS code for the parent of this project.

‚ñ£ Position and overflow properties are most important to include.

‚ñ£ Then this div element is referred to as the image inside this parent element.

‚ñ£ The "absolute" is set to position property.

**_‚óì JavaScript code for this project._**

‚ñ£ Now we have to select the required HTML elements using JavaScript.

‚ñ£ An image and both range input elements will be selected using JavaScript.

‚ñ£ Now, we have to listen to events on both range input elements.

‚ñ£ For the **vertical** image position inside the container, we have to collect the value from the range input element and concatenate it with the "%" unit.

‚ñ£ Then assigned it as the value of the "top" property.

‚ñ£ For the **horizontal** image position inside the container, we have to collect the value from the range input element and concatenate it with the "%" unit.

‚ñ£ Then assigned it as the value of the "left" property for the image element.
