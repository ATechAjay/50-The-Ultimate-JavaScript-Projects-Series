‚õî Now we have to add a function for the functionality of the progress step pages, so I've divided this function into 3 parts.

1Ô∏è‚É£ For circles
2Ô∏è‚É£ For line
3Ô∏è‚É£ For the button disabled or not

‚ó© So we are going to create a function called "refresh( )" that is responsible for the progress step page. [pic.twitter.com/Cbcmgnz8fu](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1547130838071930881/photo/1)

1Ô∏è‚É£ For circles

‚ó© Now we have to iterate those circles, if the value of the "index" variable is less than the "active" value then we have to add the ".active" classes to the circle elements or vice-versa. [pic.twitter.com/U750i2lJpG](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1547130843889483776/photo/1)

2Ô∏è‚É£ For line

‚ó© Then we have to implement the line status according to the ".active" classes.

‚ó© I've created a new variable to find the current location of the line. [pic.twitter.com/E9ethnh7eg](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1547130851489505281/photo/1)

![3_1547122287920287745](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FXh7hhuUEAEs546.jpg)

‚ó© Here is the logic for the exact location of the circles and lines.

‚ó© At the first circle:
- length of the line = 1
- Number of circles = 5
and so on...

‚ó© And just we have to divide the length by the number of circles and multiply them by 100 as well. [pic.twitter.com/uhYFgfbqat](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1547130858397503489/photo/1)

![3_1547123010850631681](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FXh8Lm2VsAEFXgk.jpg)

‚ó© After multiplying, we have to concatenate the "%" sign with those values.

‚ó© Still, we are not getting the exact location of the circles and lines.

üí°That's why we have to subtract 1 from both of them.

‚ó© Without subtraction the exact status of the line and circle on each click:

‚ó© 1st click(2nd circle):
- value of line = 2
- total num of circle = 5
and so on... [pic.twitter.com/vkX4icMctF](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1547130869420134400/photo/1)

![3_1547125511813402624](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FXh-dLqVEAACCWr.jpg)

‚ó© After subtracting from both of them the value of line and circles:

‚ó© 1st click(2nd circle):
- value of line = 1
- total num of circle = 4
and so on...

üòú We are ignoring the first circle! [pic.twitter.com/QYJH7dgz40](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1547130878089826305/photo/1)

‚õî Take your time to understand this:)

3Ô∏è‚É£ For the button disabled or not!

‚ó© At start:
- If the value of the "active" variable is equal to 1 then the "prev" button will be disabled.

‚ó© At last:
- If the value of the "active" variable is equal to the number of circles then the "next" button will be disabled.

‚õîOtherwise not disabled! [pic.twitter.com/h16ZVgUzsx](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1547130889074749440/photo/1)
