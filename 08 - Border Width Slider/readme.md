👀 Someone said to me, Hey Ajay this is the ultimate project?

😊 So I think you are also thinking that what a nonsense project.

💡 But I want to say to you that I have divided a huge SASS project into multiple parts.

😍And I will build them one by one and finally combine and💥

📌 So this is the HTML code for the project.

◈ There are 2 elements in this container that are a div element and a range slider.

◈ In range slider:
- min = 0 (px)
- max = 25 (px)
- value = 0 (Initial value for the thumb) [pic.twitter.com/fdXl70LfF1](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1536976598062100481/photo/1)

📌 In the CSS code, I have set 0px as the border of this div element.

◈ And just we have to change this value using JavaScript. [pic.twitter.com/Oqc9LLTsnf](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1536976604441636864/photo/1)

📌 In the JavaScript part, We have to select all required HTML elements.

◈ Like, as a div element and a range input element. [pic.twitter.com/LRHul5QtD8](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1536976610498183169/photo/1)

◈ Then we have to collect the value from the range input element.

◈ After getting the value, we have to concatenate it with the "px" unit.

◈ rangeSlider.value returns the value from the range input element and then concatenates it with the "px" unit. [pic.twitter.com/SVyaKK5ETj](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1536976616185688064/photo/1)

![3_1536976612167602176](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FVRwFeRVUAAqQIV.png)

◈ And finally, once we got the value from the input element assigned it as the value of the border-width property.

⛔ I've already discussed the "input" event in the previous threads don't forget to check it out. [pic.twitter.com/OuJg4V5ls4](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1536976621957042176/photo/1)
