### 🛠 How to build it? 👇

📌 As a web developer, we have to make sure to always keep updated our website.

📌 The Footer section is one of them because here we have to keep updating the year.

😍 That's why this thread comes to the rescue.

- Just we have to call the Date( ) function using the "getFullYear()" method.

- getFullYear() returns the year in the form of 4 digits.

- And assign it as the date of the footer section.
