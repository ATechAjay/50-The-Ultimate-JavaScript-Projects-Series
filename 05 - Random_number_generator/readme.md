💡 Learning from this project? 
 
📌 Math Object
📌 Random Method
📌 Trunc Method

🛠 It's used when we want to build a ludo/dice game.

→ This is the HTML code for this small project. [pic.twitter.com/Nbcm08N9Cv](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1518198392681230337/photo/1)

→ First of all, we have to select these HTML elements using JavaScript. [pic.twitter.com/ei8UhuoJbT](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1518198398343475201/photo/1)

→ Now we have to use the random method of the Math function of JavaScript.

📌 Math Object

→ Math object all you to perform the mathematical tasks on numbers.

→ Properties and methods can be called using the Math object.

→ Math object works only with the number data type.

→ The Math object is a built-in object that has some properties and methods for mathematical calculations.

📌 Random Method

→ This is a method of the Math object that is used to generate random numbers.

→ It generates random numbers between 0 and 1 but less than 1. [pic.twitter.com/lAF6RVwuBl](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1518198407738761216/photo/1)

→ But if we want to generate in the bigger range then we have to multiple with that max number. 

→ Now the number generated will be between 0 to 100 or 0 to 101 but 101 is not included. [pic.twitter.com/n9UB0vp9mF](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1518198413862481921/photo/1)

![3_1518198409487785986](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRG5aOAVIAIHmNf.png)

→ But this method generated a number with decimal values that's why we have to remove that fractional numbers.

📌 Trunc Method

→ This is also a method of the Math object that is used to remove fractional digits after the dot.

→ Or, it returns the integer value.

→ Or, its return a value without fractional value.

→ Or, it truncates the digit to the right of the dot in other words it simply removes the fractional digit.

→ This method is newly added in JavaScript(ES6) [pic.twitter.com/inkqEQ71wj](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1518198422796337153/photo/1)

→ So finally, we have to implement a click event on this button and change the number on each click.

→ It returns the number between 0 to 100. [pic.twitter.com/14BGiYwAiX](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1518198429087780866/photo/1)
