📌 As a web developer, we have to make sure to always keep updated our website.

📌 The Footer section is one of them because here we have to keep updating the year.

😍 That's why this thread comes to the rescue.

- So, it's a mini-project just we have to include 3 lines of JavaScript code.

 - And the date of the footer will automatically change every year.

- Just we have to call the Date( ) function using the "getFullYear()" method.

- getFullYear() returns the year in the form of 4 digits.

- And assign it as the date of the footer section. [pic.twitter.com/zo6LxIIjjj](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1542098408499843072/photo/1)
