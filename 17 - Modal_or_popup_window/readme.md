📌 Learning from this project?

① How to remove the class from the element.

② How to add class to the element. 

③ Keyboard event. 

📌 3 ways to close the modal

1. Close button
2. Escape key
3. Click outside from the content of the modal

⛔ I am not going to discuss HTML and CSS code, you can just copy and paste from the codepen link or you can design as your requirement.

📌 But HTML code is important for the selection using JavaScript, so you see it in the image👇 [pic.twitter.com/xTGLULeMrY](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1516638630495678465/photo/1)

📌BTW, we have to create all elements of the modal and just we have to manipulate that modal using JavaScript.

💡Simple Logic

⇾ Initially, the content of the modal will be hidden by default.

⇾ But when we click on this button 👇 then the content of the modal will be visible. [pic.twitter.com/7bKtoqC2qG](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1516638636577488900/photo/1)

💡 In short 

⇾ When we click on the button then the "hidden-modal" class will be removed from the content of the modal.

⇾ There are 2 classes in the content of the modal.

1. modal-content
2. hidden-modal

1. modal-content: Modal content is designed by using this class.

2. hidden-modal: But this class has only one line of code that is "display: none",

📌 If we remove the "hidden-modal" class then the content of the modal will be visible.

📌 Or, if we click on the Close button or Escape key or Outside from the content of the modal then the "hidden-modal" will be added.

⇾ We can close the modal using 3 ways.

1. Using the close button
2. Using the Escape key
3. And click outside from the content of the modal.

🛠 In short

✨ To visible the modal = we have to remove the hidden class

✨ To hide the modal = we have to add the hidden class

📌 Now in this project, we have to select 4 HTML elements. 

1. Open button
2. Content of the modal
3. Close button
4. Blur background [pic.twitter.com/otIrHggxQh](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1516638654118068226/photo/1)

![3_1516638649521041408](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FQwu0PVUcAAm_0c.png)

⇾ So now when we click on the open button then the "hidden-modal" class will be removed.

⇾ Well, we can add or remove the class using the "classList" property.

📌 What is classList?

⇾ The classList property returns the CSS class names of an element.

⇾ Or, it returns the DOMTokenList.

⇾ DOMTokenList is the collection of the class.

⇾ classList is the read-only property and has methods as well.

⇾ Or, the classList property has methods which used to manipulate the class of an element.

📌 Methods of the classList

⇾ add( ) :- Add one or more class to the element.

⇾ remove ( ) :- Remove one or more classes from the element.

⇾ contains ( ) :- Returns true if the element contains the given class otherwise returns false.

⛔ And many more methods of classList property, which we will discuss in the upcoming projects.

① How to remove the class from the element.

⇾ We can remove the class to the element using the remove() method of the classList property.

⇾ But it happens when we click on the open button.

⇾ So we have to listen to an event which is a "click" event on the open button.

📌 Also, we have a blurred background and have 2 classes as well.

1.  blur-bg (Blur bg design using this class)
2. hidden-blur (display: none)

⇾ Now again we have to remove this "hidden-blur" class when we click on the open button. [pic.twitter.com/9yme5b2wvI](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1516638673856475136/photo/1)
