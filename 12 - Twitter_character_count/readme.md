A Thread🧵👇 [pic.twitter.com/hJhKyEmMFX](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1531841330603003904/video/1)

🛠 In this project, there are 3 child elements in a container.

1.  Heading of the project
2. Result of the number
3. Input field [pic.twitter.com/r1PIiXrRuK](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1531841339587198976/photo/1)

😍 Now the time comes to implement a JavaScript logic for this feature.

◈ So, first of all, we have to select the required HTML elements using JavaScript. [pic.twitter.com/Q8aqeRq6DF](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1531841347568963589/photo/1)

![3_1531825333259108353](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUIjBk7agAEt-gz.png)

◈ Then we have to set the maximum limit of the character in a new variable.

◈ So, the maximum number of characters will be 280, that's why I have created a new variable that is maxLength. 

◈ And replace this value as an initial value of the project using textContent. [pic.twitter.com/1QL7ZzB2Ms](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1531841354015580160/photo/1)

◈ Now the maximum(280) value is displayed on the screen. [pic.twitter.com/PC6rq8b2gb](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1531841361712152576/photo/1)

◈ After that, we have to listen to an event on each character of the input field.

◈ Listen to an event on the input field which is textarea in this case.

◈ Now I've created a new variable called currentCount. [pic.twitter.com/GexoVukyzw](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1531841369144459264/photo/1)

![3_1531826587129516032](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUIkKj9akAAp8_t.png)

◈ In the "currentCount" variable, we have to store the current number of characters.

◈ So on each event, we have calculated the length of the characters minus the maximum length of the characters.

Eg:

280 - 12, if we input 12 characters in the input field.

◈ After that, we have to change the maximum number with the current number on each event.

◈ So we need to change the maximum number with the current number using textContent inside the function.

◈ Finally, we have to implement the text and border color when we reach at 0.

◈ Just use the "if" and "else" statement for this requirement.

◈ If the current number is less than 0, then the text and border color will be red else white. [pic.twitter.com/kzfxfjqEmS](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1531841383698690048/photo/1)
